Do not use and css inline or outline

- Use creativity to create nice UI with modern react components 
- Follow every prompt and dont stop untill you get it right as per the prompt.
- When you get stuck with a same problem and not able to fix and get it right try to 
get out of that wrong loop and do reverse engineering to fix is with different strategy.
- use only reactt components and not any inline or outline css 
- use material UI instead .
